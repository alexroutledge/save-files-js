save-files-js
=============

This is a simple demo illustrating how you can use the HTML5 Blob and download APIs to save generated files locally using Javascript.

Typically, this type of functionality has required Flash support and involved a server side component. The intention is that this example could be extended for use in such scenarios.

Current browser support:

-Chrome

-Safari

-Firefox

-IE10+
